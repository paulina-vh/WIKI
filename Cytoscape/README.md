## Introduction
Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and integrating these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data. Although Cytoscape was originally designed for biological research, now it is a general platform for complex network analysis and visualization. Cytoscape core distribution provides a basic set of features for data integration, analysis, and visualization. Additional features are available as Apps, which are available for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support, scripting, and connection with databases. Most of the Apps are freely available from [Cytoscape App Store](https://apps.cytoscape.org/). Cytoscape is a Java desktop application designed for large-scale network analysis and visualization with features, including new user interfaces, advanced visualization functions, headless (command-line) distribution, RESTful API, and multiple rendering engine support.
